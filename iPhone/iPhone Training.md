# iPhone Training

Student Name:  
Date:

This checklist will facilitate the learning, and the verification of
knowledge, of iPhone concepts useful for the blind. It is designed to
be used in instruction or assessment of a blind person who owns an
iPhone, or who may be eligible for said device. This checklist assumes
that the instructor or assessor has knowledge of using an iPhone with
VoiceOver, but more obscure tasks will have links to articles on their
use. Explanation to students of these concepts, if needed, is
encouraged. Items beginning with “(Instructor)” should be done or
explained by the instructor, if needed, to the student.

Please type the student’s name, and date if needed, into the headings
provided at the top. You don’t have to replace the text, just put a
space after the colon, and type the information. A space has been
created at the end of each set of items for notes from the instructor
or assessor.

## Basic

This checklist will cover basic iPhone familiarity with hardware,
through using Siri. This is primarily to be used with the elderly, or
those who have no need of using apps with VoiceOver. Advanced users
should, however, be given this part as a precursor to the advanced
section.

In order for these items to be considered complete, the user must be
able to find or complete the item without assistance.

### iPhone Hardware

screen, and functions of each button. The student should be able to
complete the following:

- Find the power button
